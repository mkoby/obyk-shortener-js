# ObyK URL Shortener (node.js version)

## CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS

This thing is far from done.

*   The HTML form needs to be finished being moved to Jade.
*   CSS needs to be moved out of the HTML and into CSS files
*   Needs a data backend

## About

This is a version of my [URL shortener](http://obyk.us), the code for which can be found on Github at [https://github.com/mkoby/obyk-shortener](https://github.com/mkoby/obyk-shortener), written using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

This was a way for me to try writing a web application using Javascript, to both learn more Javascript and to learn a Javascript framework.


## License

### Why the GPL
I know some people that really dislike the GPL, however I would like changes to be brought back into this source tree here.  Though to be honest, I'm not going to be too much of a stickler about it.
